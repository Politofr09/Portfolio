## Description & Why?
- The engine is designed support both 2D and 3D rendering through OpenGL, with a responsive and modern looking editor interface. It's cross platform, running on both Windows and Linux. I try to rely as less as possible on platform-specific code. Currently, the engine supports serialization, basic rendering and asset management.
- The main purpose of this engine is to teach myself about game engine architecture and take a look at how they work under the hood.
